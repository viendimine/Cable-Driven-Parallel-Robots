# Cable-Driven Parallel Robots
Cable-driven parallel robots use multiple cables to control the position and orientation of a platform in 3D space. The cables are attached to fixed points and are adjusted by motors to move the platform. These robots offer high speed and maneuverability, making them ideal for applications like aerial photography and filming. The platform's movement is precisely controlled by varying cable tensions, calculated to ensure stability and prevent cable slack or breakage. The robots' dynamic equations account for inertia, external forces, and gravity, enabling smooth, real-time adjustments for accurate positioning and motion.

## Objective
The continuity and real-time performances of the cable tension determining for a camera robot parallel driven by four
cables are dealt.
Up to now there are two open challenges for guaranteeing the continuity and
real-time performances brought about by the speedability and maneuverability of a camera robot. For this purpose,
firstly, a non-iterative polynomial-based optimization algorithm is presented based on the convex optimization theory,
in which six different optimal objective functions are utilized. Then, the continuity of the algorithm is proved and the
continuity indices are presented. Moreover, the real-time performance of the algorithm is analyzed and the real-time
indices are developed.

## Problem
Camera robots need to quickly and smoothly adjust cable tensions to maintain their position and movement accurately. Poor real-time performance can cause the robot to deviate from the desired path, while inconsistent tension can make the robot vibrate, leading to blurry images. Frequent rapid movements make these issues worse, causing instability. Ensuring real-time responsiveness and consistent cable tension is crucial for the camera robot to operate smoothly and capture clear images.
